Many multistoried Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame buildings have basement floors, below ground level, for providing parking space and other utilities. It also have significant influence in seismic resistance and providing lateral stiffness to the building. Shear wall also helps in resisting horizontal loading which may be wind load or seismic load. In the present study, the influence of basement on the Seismic Behaviour of Multistoried RC Frame Buildings with shear walls and without shear walls is investigated. RC shear walls has an important role specifically in high rise buildings exposed to horizontal seismic and wind loads. In a tall building, earthquake resistance can be achieved by providing proper stiffness, strength and ductility to the structures.
